Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:

<br>

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Mechatronics at the Technische Universit√§t Hamburg (TUHH). My passion lies in developing robotic systems that address real-world problems. My journey began with a foundation in mechanical engineering, where I discovered a fascination for computers and programming. This intersection of interests naturally led me to the field of robotics, where I can combine my skills in both areas.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have dedicated significant time to working with microcontrollers and programming. This experience has now expanded into developing software for intelligent systems. What started as a hobby has evolved into a deep-seated passion and career path.

I am always on the lookout for opportunities where my skills can intersect with creating value for others. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects that have the potential to make a positive impact. This drive to innovate and help others through technology is what motivates me every day.
