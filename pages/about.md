# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
Growing up, I would dismantle every gadget at sight in attempt to understand how and why they work. This curiosity led me to opt for mechanical engineering as undergraduate studies. At the end of four years, I was able to create things physically that I would imagine but I lacked the knowledge to provide them with reasoning and intelligence. So, I embarked on a journey to study Mechatronics at TU Hamburg. During the journey I developed a passion for Robotics and Computer Vision. I was privileged to gain hands on experience with these technologies in the form of internships, hackathons and student clubs. Several of my projects were recognized in various contests, and one of them ended up being selected for public display at a robotics museum. Such experiences have fueled my passion and convinced me that I can pursue this as a career for the rest of my life.

My personal and professional experiences have taught me the following about myself:
- I enjoy writing code for the things that move.
- I can bring ideas to life and create prototypes for projects using CAD and 3D printing.
- I am passionate about bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds, and I am enthusiastic about the intersection of robotics and AI.
- I am constantly learning and enjoy exploring emerging technologies to find ways to apply them to my work.
- I find pleasure in solving real-world problems using hardware and software.
- It brings me joy to help others on the subjects that I have good knowledge of.
- In whatever roles I have been associated with in the past, work hasn’t felt like work.
- I love mobile robotics and especially legged robots.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages. Currently, I have experience with Python, C++, Java, and ROS/ROS2. I’m enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages, frameworks, or principles I can integrate into my workflow. I wholeheartedly believe that robotics and AI will transform our societies in a really impactful way.

In my free time you might find me: reading non-fiction, scrolling through medium, cooking or playing badminton. I am always open to collaboration and eager to discuss new ideas and opportunities.

Please feel free to contact me via LinkedIn. I’m always looking forward to an insightful conversation!
