# Mechano-B Quadruped Robot

## Project Overview

As part of a state-level robotics competition, my team and I developed Mechano-B, a quadruped robot with 12 degrees of freedom, featuring three motors per leg. The primary goal was to make the robot walk on flat surfaces and slopes. This project not only earned us first prize but also state-level recognition and a spot for public display at a robotics museum.

## My Role

- **Sketching and 3D Modeling:** The process began with sketching the robot’s design on paper, which was then transformed into a detailed 3D model using SolidWorks. This model guided the 3D printing process for the robot’s construction.
- **Programming:** I was responsible for programming the walking gait pattern, enabling the robot to mimic the movement of a four-legged animal. This task involved solving the inverse kinematics for the walking gait pattern using SolidWorks motion analysis and implementing the control logic using Arduino.

## Technical Details

- **Degrees of Freedom:** Mechano-B has 12 degrees of freedom, with each leg equipped with three motors.
- **Movement Capabilities:** The robot can perform various actions such as walking, turning, trotting, and pushups.
- **Control System:** The inverse kinematics were solved in SolidWorks and then programmed into the robot via Arduino to synchronize the 12 motors for stable walking motion.

## Challenges and Solutions

One of the biggest challenges was figuring out the inverse kinematics and coordinating and calibrating all 12 motors to achieve a stable walking motion. After many days of trial and error, we successfully made the robot walk seamlessly. Although we couldn't make it climb stairs, the experience was incredibly educational.

## Achievements

- **Recognition:** The project won first prize at the state-level competition and received state-level recognition along with a prize money of 500,000 INR.
- **Public Display:** Mechano-B was selected for public display at a robotics museum in Gujarat, India.
